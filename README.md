# 3DCasting
It is time to update the process of healing fractures and injuries that do not need bandaging, the methods used today are primitive.


IDEA: 
  STEP 1: Take a 3D scan of the injured limb in an anatomically correct position
  STEP 2: Import the scan into a 3D modelling software ( such as 3-MATIC)
  STEP 3: Scale a pre-made model onto the limb 
  STEP 4: Use 3D printer to print the cast
  STEP 5: Install any extra padding or accessories as needed
  STEP 6: Fit patient with cast and ensure affected limb is properly immobilized in an anatomically correct position
  
  
 BENEFITS: 
  - Capable of being submerged in water for any amount of time due to the material ( no more shower bags )
  - Can be tweaked to fit the needs of the specific injury 
  - Can be customized to a greater degree
  - Can accept newer technologies that could potentially decrease healing time
  - Could potentially allow patient to retain more functionality of affected limb
  
  
  
 NOTES:
- The 3D Scanning seems like a daunting task, however this can be achieved with a kinect from an xbox and a windows PC.
( EXAMPLE: https://i.materialise.com/blog/en/3d-scanning-tutorial-microsoft-kinect-and-3d-builder/ )

- Using this process, we would be able to access the site of the injury without removing the cast, therefore we would be able to apply 
therapies that require this. One example would be using ultrasound therapy which increases calcium ion production and can potentially
decrease the healing time. ( SOURCE: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2748418/ )
